"SUSE Edge is a purpose-built, tightly integrated, and comprehensively "
"validated end-to-end solution for addressing the unique challenges of the "
"deployment of infrastructure and cloud-native applications at the edge. Its "
"driving focus is to provide an opinionated, yet highly flexible, highly "
"scalable, and secure platform that spans initial deployment image building, "
"node provisioning and onboarding, application deployment, observability, and "
"complete lifecycle operations. The platform is built on best-of-breed open "
"source software from the ground up, consistent with both our 30-year history "
"in delivering secure, stable, and certified SUSE Linux platforms and our "
"experience in providing highly scalable and feature-rich Kubernetes "
"management with our Rancher portfolio. SUSE Edge builds on-top of these "
"capabilities to deliver functionality that can address a wide number of "
"market segments, including retail, medical, transportation, logistics, "
"telecommunications, smart manufacturing, and Industrial IoT."

"The solution is designed with the notion that there is no \"one-size-fits-"
"all\" edge platform due to customers’ widely varying requirements and "
"expectations. Edge deployments push us to solve, and continually evolve, "
"some of the most challenging problems, including massive scalability, "
"restricted network availability, physical space constraints, new security "
"threats and attack vectors, variations in hardware architecture and system "
"resources, the requirement to deploy and interface with legacy "
"infrastructure and applications, and customer solutions that have extended "
"lifespans. Since many of these challenges are different from traditional "
"ways of thinking, e.g. deployment of infrastructure and applications within "
"data centers or in the public cloud, we have to look into the design in much "
"more granular detail, and rethinking many common assumptions."

"For example, we find value in minimalism, modularity, and ease of "
"operations. Minimalism is important for edge environments since the more "
"complex a system is, the more likely it is to break. When looking at "
"hundreds of locations, up to hundreds of thousands, complex systems will "
"break in complex ways.  Modularity in our solution allows for more user "
"choice while removing unneeded complexity in the deployed platform. We also "
"need to balance these with the ease of operations. Humans may make mistakes "
"when repeating a process thousands of times, so the platform should make "
"sure any potential mistakes are recoverable, eliminating the need for on-"
"site technician visits, but also strive for consistency and standardization."

"Directed network provisioning is where you know the details of the hardware "
"you wish to deploy to and have direct access to the out-of-band management "
"interface to orchestrate and automate the entire provisioning process. In "
"this scenario, our customers expect a solution to be able to provision edge "
"sites fully automated from a centralized location, going much further than "
"the creation of a boot image by minimizing the manual operations at the edge "
"location; simply rack, power, and attach the required networks to the "
"physical hardware, and the automation process powers up the machine via the "
"out-of-band management (e.g. via the Redfish API) and handles the "
"provisioning, onboarding, and deployment of infrastructure without user "
"intervention. The key for this to work is that the systems are known to the "
"administrators; they know which hardware is in which location, and that "
"deployment is expected to be handled centrally."

"Sometimes you are operating in an environment where the central management "
"cluster cannot manage the hardware directly (for example, your remote "
"network is behind a firewall or there is no out-of-band management "
"interface; common in \"PC\" type hardware often found at the edge). In this "
"scenario, we provide tooling to remotely provision clusters and their "
"workloads with no need to know where hardware is being shipped when it is "
"bootstrapped. This is what most people think of when they think about edge "
"computing; it’s the thousands or tens of thousands of somewhat unknown "
"systems booting up at edge locations and securely phoning home, validating "
"who they are, and receiving their instructions on what they’re supposed to "
"do. Our requirements here expect provisioning and lifecycle management with "
"very little user-intervention other than either pre-imaging the machine at "
"the factory, or simply attaching a boot image, e.g. via USB, and switching "
"the system on. The primary challenges in this space are addressing scale, "

"For customers that need to operate in standalone, air-gapped, or network "

"to generate fully customized installation media that contains all of the "
"required deployment artifacts to enable both single-node and multi-node "
"highly-available Kubernetes clusters at the edge, including any workloads or "
"additional layered components required, all without any network connectivity "
"to the outside world, and without the intervention of a centralized "
"management platform. The user-experience follows closely to the \"phone "
"home\" solution in that installation media is provided to the target "
"systems, but the solution will \"bootstrap in-place\". In this scenario, "
"it’s possible to attach the resulting clusters into Rancher for ongoing "
"management (i.e. going from a \"disconnected\" to \"connected\" mode of "
"operation without major reconfiguration or redeployment), or can continue to "
"operate in isolation. Note that in both cases the same consistent mechanism "

"Before we begin, it is important to recognize that besides the NVIDIA open-"
"driver that SUSE ships as part of SLE Micro, you might also need additional "
"NVIDIA components for your setup. These could include OpenGL libraries, CUDA "
"toolkits, command-line utilities such as <literal>nvidia-smi</literal>, and "
"container-integration components such as <literal>nvidia-container-toolkit</"
"literal>. Many of these components are not shipped by SUSE as they are "
"proprietary NVIDIA software, or it makes no sense for us to ship them "
"instead of NVIDIA. Therefore, as part of the instructions, we are going to "
"configure additional repositories that give us access to said components and "
"walk through certain examples of how to use these tools, resulting in a "
"fully functional system. It is important to distinguish between SUSE "
"repositories and NVIDIA repositories, as occasionally there can be a "
"mismatch between the package versions that NVIDIA makes available versus "
"what SUSE has built. This usually arises when SUSE makes a new version of "
"the open-driver available, and it takes a couple of days before the "
"equivalent packages are made available in NVIDIA repositories to match."

"Please note that SUSE must occasionally deprecate features or change API "
"specifications. Reasons for feature deprecation or API change could include "
"a feature being updated or replaced by a new implementation, a new feature "
"set, upstream technology is no longer available, or the upstream community "
"has introduced incompatible changes. It is not intended that this will ever "
"happen within a given minor release (x.z), and so all z-stream releases will "
"maintain API compatibility and feature functionality. SUSE will endeavor to "
"provide deprecation warnings with plenty of notice within the release notes, "

"disruption."
