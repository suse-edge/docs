== Create the project to host the assets

In this case it will be a _subproject_ of the "home:foobar" project

. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/
. Log in
. Select "Your Home Project" (Left Nav menu)
. Select the "Subprojects" tab
. Press "Create Subproject" (In Left Nav menu);
. Fill in the name (e.g. containers).

== Enable container builds in the project config

. Select "Your Home Project" (Left Nav menu)
. Select the "Subprojects" tab
. Select the subproject you have created (e.g. containers)
. Select the "Project Config" tab
. Paste the following code:
+
[,shell]
----
%if "%_repository" == "images"
Type: docker
Repotype: none
Patterntype: none
BuildEngine: podman
%endif
----

== Add the Tumbleweed images repository

. Go to the subproject home page (e.g. https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/home:foobar:containers)
. Select the "Repositories" tab
. Press the "Add from a Project" button
. Fill in "Project" field with `openSUSE:Templates:Images:Tumbleweed``
. Choose "images" in Repositories dropdown
. Rename it as "images" (this is important as it will be later on used in the registry path)
. Unselect all the architectures you don't need

== Create a package for the subproject

. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:foobar:containers
. Press "Create Package" button
. Fill in the name (e.g. mytoolbox).

== Create the Dockerfile

Create a simple Dockerfile locally, something like:

[,shell]
----
# The container image tag needs to be specified as follows:
#!BuildTag: mytoolbox:latest

FROM opensuse/tumbleweed
RUN zypper -n in traceroute iputils netcat-openbsd curl && \
    zypper clean -a
----

== Upload the Dockerfile

. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:foobar:containers/mytoolbox
. Press the "Add File" button
. Choose the file and upload it

== Build results

. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:foobar:containers/mytoolbox
. Images will appear in Build Results section
. Press the "Refresh" button in Build Results section
. Wait for build results.

== Resulting images

If everything went as it should, the container image will be hosted at the https://registry.opensuse.org/[openSUSE registry]

. Go to https://registry.opensuse.org/
. On the search bar, type "project={caret}home:foobar:" and press enter
. Click on the package icon or name (home/foobar/containers/images/mytoolbox)
. Expand the tag (latest) to see the Image IDs, arch, build time, etc as well as the `podman pull` command.

== Modify the Dockerfile file via CLI

. Install `osc` via your favourite package manager (see https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC)
. Run `osc checkout home:foobar:containers`. It will ask your username/password and a method to store the password safely.
. Navigate to the downloaded project `cd home\:foobar\:containers/mytoolbox/`
. Edit the `Dockerfile` as needed
. Run `osc commit` and put a proper commit message
. The build will be automatically triggered
