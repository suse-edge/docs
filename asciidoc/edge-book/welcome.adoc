Welcome to the SUSE Edge documentation! In this set of documentation you will find quick starts, our validated designs, how we use components, our 3rd-party integrations, and best practices for managing your edge computing workloads.

== What is SUSE Edge?

The SUSE Edge is a purpose-built cloud native edge computing platform for managing the full lifecycle of edge devices at scale. It is built by putting together open source components into a set of validated designs that we know work together to solve the different constraints we find when designing for and operating edge environments.

== Which Quick Start should you use?

Because there is a varied set of operating environments that each come with their own set of constraints, we support a few different ways to provision your devices.

=== Direct Network Provisioning

When you know the hardware being used and have direct access to the out of band management interface, we provide a solution based on Cluster API and Metal^3^. 

This solution is the most robust since you are directly interacting with the hardware's management interface and have less constraints on communication.

The quick start for this solution can be found at <<quickstart-metal3>>

=== "Phone Home" Network Provisioning

Sometimes you are operating in an environment where the central management cluster can't manage the hardware directly (e.g. your remote network is behind a firewall or there is no out of band management interface). In this scenario, we provide tooling to remotely provision clusters and their workloads without needing to know where hardware is being shipped when it's bootstrapped.


The quick start for this solution can be found at <<quickstart-elemental>>

=== Image Based Provisioning

Lastly, for airgapped environments or ones with unreliable networks we provide tooling to easily and repeatably build installation media that includes all of the needed artifacts when installing. This includes your workload.

The quick start for this solution can be found at <<quickstart-eib>>


== Design Philosophy

SUSE Edge is designed and built based on the constraints commonly found in edge environments. Since these are different from data centers, this meant rethinking many more common assumptions.

For example, we find value in minimalism, modularity, and ease of operations. 

Minimalism is important for edge environments since the more complex a system is, the more likely it is to break. When looking at 100s to 100,000s of locations, complex systems will break in complex ways. 

Modularity in our solution allows for more user choice while removing unneeded complexity in the deployed platform. 

We also need to balance these with the ease of operations. Humans will make mistakes when repeating a process 1000s of times so the platform should make sure any potential mistakes are recoverable without needing a technician to go on site.
