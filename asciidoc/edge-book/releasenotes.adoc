== Abstract

SUSE Edge 3.0 is a tightly integrated and comprehensively validated end-to-end solution for addressing the unique challenges of the deployment of infrastructure and cloud-native applications at the edge. Its driving focus is to provide an opinionated, yet highly flexible, highly scalable, and secure platform that spans initial deployment image building, node provisioning and onboarding, application deployment, observability, and lifecycle management.

The solution is designed with the notion that there is no "one-size-fits-all" edge platform due to our customersâ€™ widely varying requirements and expectations. Edge deployments push us to solve, and continually evolve, some of the most challenging problems, including massive scalability, restricted network availability, physical space constraints, new security threats and attack vectors, variations in hardware architecture and system resources, the requirement to deploy and interface with legacy infrastructure and applications, and customer solutions that have extended lifespans.

SUSE Edge is built on best-of-breed open source software from the ground up, consistent with both our 30-year history in delivering secure, stable, and certified SUSE Linux platforms and our experience in providing highly scalable and feature-rich Kubernetes management with our Rancher portfolio. SUSE Edge builds on-top of these capabilities to deliver functionality that can address a wide number of market segments, including retail, medical, transportation, logistics, telecommunications, smart manufacturing, and Industrial IoT.

NOTE: SUSE Adaptive Telco Infrastructure Platform (ATIP) is a derivative (or downstream product) of SUSE Edge, with additional optimizations and components that enable the platform to address the requirements found in telecommunications use-cases. Unless explicitly stated, all of the release notes are applicable for both SUSE Edge 3.0, and SUSE ATIP 3.0.

== About the release notes

These Release Notes are, unless explicitly specified and explained, identical across all architectures, and the most recent version, along with the release notes of all other SUSE products are always available online at https://www.suse.com/releasenotes[https://www.suse.com/releasenotes].

Entries are only listed once, but they can be referenced in several places if they are important and belong to more than one section. Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two subsequent releases. Certain important entries from the release notes of previous product versions may be repeated. To make these entries easier to identify, they contain a note to that effect.

However, repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only. Therefore, if you are skipping one or releases, check the release notes of the skipped releases also. If you are only reading the release notes of the current release, you could miss important changes that may affect system behavior.

NOTE: SUSE Edge z-stream releases are tightly integrated and thoroughly tested as a versioned stack. Upgrade of any individual components to a different versions to those listed above is likely to result in system downtime. While it's possible to run Edge clusters in untested configurations, it is not recommended, and it may take longer to provide resolution through the support channels.

=== Components Verification

The components mentioned above may be verified using the Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) data - for example using cosign as outlined below:

Download the SUSE Edge Container public key from https://www.suse.com/support/security/keys/

[,bash]
----
include::key.sh[]
----

Verify the container image hash, for example using crane

[,bash]
----
> crane digest registry.suse.com/edge/baremetal-operator:0.5.1
sha256:13e8b2c59aeb503f8adaac095495007071559c9d6d8ef5a7cb1ce6fd1430c782
----

Verify with cosign

[,bash]
----
> cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson --key key.pem registry.suse.com/edge/baremetal-operator@sha256:13e8b2c59aeb503f8adaac095495007071559c9d6d8ef5a7cb1ce6fd1430c782 > /dev/null
#
Verification for registry.suse.com/edge/baremetal-operator@sha256:13e8b2c59aeb503f8adaac095495007071559c9d6d8ef5a7cb1ce6fd1430c782 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The claims were present in the transparency log
  - The signatures were integrated into the transparency log when the certificate was valid
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
----

It is also possible to extract SBOM data as described at https://www.suse.com/support/security/sbom/

[,bash]
----
> cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson --key key.pem registry.suse.com/edge/baremetal-operator@sha256:13e8b2c59aeb503f8adaac095495007071559c9d6d8ef5a7cb1ce6fd1430c782 | jq '.payload | @base64d | fromjson | .predicate'

=== Upgrade Steps

* Not Applicable - this is the first release shipped in 3.0.z, and is a new architecture introduced for the first time.

=== Known Limitations

* Akri is released for the first time as a Technology Preview offering, and is not subject to the standard scope of support.
* Rancher UI Extensions used in SUSE Edge cannot currently be deployed via the Rancher Marketplace and must be deployed manually. https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105[Rancher issue #29105]
* If you're using NVIDIA GPU's, SELinux cannot be enabled at the containerd layer due to a missing SELinux policy. https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1222725[Bugzilla #1222725]
* If deploying with Metal^3^ and Cluster API (CAPI), clusters aren't automatically imported into Rancher post-installation. It will be addressed in future releases.

== Product Support Lifecycle

SUSE Edge is backed by award-winning support from SUSE, an established technology leader with a proven history of delivering enterprise-quality support services. For more information, see https://www.suse.com/lifecycle[https://www.suse.com/lifecycle] and the Support Policy page at https://www.suse.com/support/policy.html[https://www.suse.com/support/policy.html]. If you have any questions about raising a support case, how SUSE classifies severity levels, or the scope of support, please see the Technical Support Handbook at https://www.suse.com/support/handbook/[https://www.suse.com/support/handbook/].

At the time of publication, each minor version of SUSE Edge, e.g. "3.0" is supported for 12-months of production support, with an initial 6-months of "full support", followed by 6-months of "maintenance support". In the "full support" coverage period, SUSE may introduce new features (that do not break existing functionality), introduce bug fixes, and deliver security patches. During the "maintenance support" window, only critical security and bug fixes will be introduced, with other fixes delivered at our discretion.

Unless explicitly stated, all components listed are considered Generally Available (GA), and are covered by SUSE's standard scope of support. Some components may be listed as "Technology Preview", where SUSE is providing customers with access to early pre-GA features and functionality for evaluation, but are not subject to the standard support policies and are not recommended for production use-cases. SUSE very much welcomes feedback and suggestions on the improvements that can be made to Technology Preview components, but SUSE reserves the right to deprecate a Technology Preview feature before it becomes Generally Available if it doesn't meet the needs of our customers or doesn't reach a state of maturity that we require.

Please note that SUSE must occasionally deprecate features or change API specifications. Reasons for feature deprecation or API change could include a feature being updated or replaced by a new implementation, a new feature set, upstream technology is no longer available, or the upstream community has introduced incompatible changes. It is not intended that this will ever happen within a given minor release (x.z), and so all z-stream releases will maintain API compatibility and feature functionality. SUSE will endeavor to provide deprecation warnings with plenty of notice within the release notes, along with workarounds, suggestions, and mitigations to minimize service disruption.

The SUSE Edge team also welcomes community feedback, where issues can be raised within the respective code repository within https://www.github.com/suse-edge[https://www.github.com/suse-edge].
