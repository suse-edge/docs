Elemental is a software stack that provides for remote control over the lifecycle of the Operating System, Kubernetes, and workload in a secure and declarative way.

== Why use this method

Elemental can be very useful for scenarios where the devices that you want to control are not on the same network as the upstream cluster or don't have a BMC onboard to allow more direct control.

This is typically the case for use-cases in Retail, IIoT, or other spaces where you don't have as much control over the network your devices are being installed in.

== High Level Architecture

TODO: Draw image

== Resources Needed

At the very least, you need:

* A host for the "upstream" cluster (the one hosting Rancher and Elemental) with:
 ** Minimum 8GB RAM and 20GB disk space for development or testing
 ** For production use: See https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements#hardware-requirements
* A host to be controlled
 ** Could be physical device or Virtual Machine
 ** Minimum 25GB disk
* A resolvable hostname
 ** Or static ip address to use with a service like sslip.io
* A host to build the installation media with https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/[Kubectl], https://podman.io[Podman], and https://helm.sh[Helm] installed
 ** This would likely be your local computer for most people
* (If using physical hardware) A USB flash drive to boot from
 ** Existing will be overwritten as part of the process

In the writing of this guide, I will be using a Digital Ocean droplet to host the upstream cluster and an Intel NUC as the downstream device. For building the installation media, I will be using my desktop running https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/[openSUSE Tumbleweed].

== How to Use Elemental

The basic steps to install and use Elemental are:

* Build bootstrap cluster
* Install Rancher
* Install Elemental Operator and Rancher UI Extension
* Build installer disk
* Boot device with installer
* Create downstream cluster

=== Build Bootstrap Cluster

The first thing we need to do is create a cluster that can host Rancher and Elemental. This cluster needs to be routable from the network that the downstream nodes are connected to.

==== Create Kubernetes Cluster

If you are using a hyperscaler (such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud), it's likely easiest to set up a cluster using their built in tooling. For the sake of conciseness in this guide, we will not be detailing the process of each of these options.

If you are installing onto bare metal or another hosting service where you need to also provide the Kubernetes distribution itself, we recommend using https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart[RKE2].

==== Setup DNS

Before continuing, you will need to setup access to your cluster. As with the setup of the cluster itself, how you configure DNS will be different depending on where it's being hosted.

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to deal with setting up DNS records (for example this is just an ephemeral test server), you can use a service like https://sslip.io[sslip.io] instead. With this service, you can resolve any ip address with `<address>.sslip.io`.
====

==== Install Rancher

To install Rancher, you need to get access to the kubeapi of the cluster you just created. This looks differently depending on what distribution of Kubernetes is being used.

For RKE2,the kubeconfig file will have been written to `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`. Save this file to `~/.kube/config` on your local system. You may need to edit the file to include the correct externally routable IP address or hostname.

The simplest way to get Rancher installed is with these commands that can be found in the https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster[Rancher Documentation]:

. Install https://cert-manager.io[cert-manager]:
+
[.tabs]
Linux::
+
[,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest

kubectl create namespace cattle-system

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update

helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
 --namespace cert-manager \
 --create-namespace
----
+
Windows::
+
[,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest

kubectl create namespace cattle-system

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml

helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager `
  --namespace cert-manager `
  --create-namespace
----
+
. Then install Rancher itself:
+
[.tabs]
Linux::
+
[,bash]
----
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=<DNS or sslip from above> \
  --set replicas=1 \
  --set bootstrapPassword=<PASSWORD_FOR_RANCHER_ADMIN>
----
+
Windows::
+
[,bash]
----
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher `
  --namespace cattle-system `
  --set hostname=<DNS or sslip from above> `
  --set replicas=1 `
  --set bootstrapPassword=<PASSWORD_FOR_RANCHER_ADMIN>
----

[NOTE]
====
If this is intended to be a production system, please use cert-manager to configure a real certificate (such as one from Let's Encrypt).
====

Browse to the hostname you set up and log in to Rancher with the bootstrapPassword you used. There is a short setup process that you will be guided through.

==== Install Elemental

With Rancher installed, you can now install Elemental itself!

The helm chart for Elemental is published as an OCI artifact so the installation is a little simpler than other charts. It can be installed from either the same shell you used to install Rancher or in the browser from within Rancher's shell.

[,bash]
----
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \
 elemental-operator-crds \
 oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-crds-chart
 
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \
 elemental-operator \
 oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-chart
----

==== (Optionally) Install the Elemental UI Extension

. If you want to use the Elemental UI, you can go log in to your Rancher instance, click on the "hamburger menu" in the top left, then
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-1.png[Installing Elemental Extension1]
+
. From the "Available" tab on this page, you can then click "Install" on the Elemental card:
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-2.png[Installing Elemental Extension 2]
+
. Confirm that you want to install the extension:
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-3.png[Installing Elemental Extension 3]
+
. After this installs, you will be prompted to reload the page.
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-4.png[Installing Elemental Extension 4]
+
. Once you reload, you can access the Elemental Extension through the "OS Management" global app.

==== Configure Elemental

For simplicity, setting the variable `$ELEM` to the full path of where you want the configuration directory is recommended, e.g. `ELEM=/home/user/elemental/`.

```
mkdir -p $ELEM
```

To allow machines to register to Elemental, we need to create a MachineRegistration object in the `fleet-default` namespace.

A fairly basic version of this object is:

[,yaml]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/registration.yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineRegistration
metadata:
  name: ele-quickstart-nodes
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  machineName: "\${System Information/Manufacturer}-\${System Information/UUID}"
  machineInventoryLabels:
    manufacturer: "\${System Information/Manufacturer}"
    productName: "\${System Information/Product Name}"
EOF
----
[NOTE]
====
* The `cat` command has `\` before each `$` so that bash doesn't template them. If you copy this manually, make sure to remove each `\`.
====

To create, use:

[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f $ELEM/registration.yaml
----

Afterwards, find and note the endpoint that gets assigned:

[,bash]
----
REGISURL=$(kubectl get machineregistration ele-quickstart-nodes -n fleet-default -o jsonpath='{.status.registrationURL}')
----

Alternatively, this can also be done from the UI.

UI Extension::
+
. From the OS Management Extension, click "Create Registration Endpoint":
+
image::click-create-registration.png[Click Create Registration]
+
. Give this configuration a name
+
image::create-registration-name.png[Add Name]
+
[NOTE]
====
You can ignore the Cloud Configuration field as the data here is overridden by the following steps with Edge Image Builder
====
. Next you can scroll down a bit and click "Add Label" for each label you want to be on the resource that gets created when a machine registers. This is useful for tracking which machine is which.
+
image::create-registration-labels.png[Add Labels]
+
. Lastly, click "Create" to save the configuration!
+
image::create-registration-create.png[Click Create]


Afterwards, find and note the endpoint that gets assigned:

[,bash]
----
REGISURL=$(kubectl get machineregistration ele-quickstart-nodes -n fleet-default -o jsonpath='{.status.registrationURL}')
----
UI Extension::
If you just created the configuration, you should see the Registration URL listed and can click "Copy" to copy the address:
+
image::get-registration-url.png[Copy URL]
+
[TIP]
====
If you clicked away from that screen you can click on "Registration Endpoints" in the left menu then click the name of the endpoint you just created.
====

This URL will be used in the next step.

=== Build installation media

While the current version of Elemental (at time of writing) does have a way to build it's own installation media, we need to do this with the Edge Image Builder instead so the resulting system is built with https://www.suse.com/products/micro/[SLE Micro] as the base Operating System.

[TIP]
====
For more details on the Edge Image Builder, you can check out the <<quickstart-eib,Getting Started Guide for it>>. Or, for a more full discussion on it's capabilities there is a [full page documenting it].
====

From a linux system with Podman installed, run


[,bash]
----
mkdir -p $ELEM/eib_quickstart/base-images
mkdir -p $ELEM/eib_quickstart/elemental
----

[,bash]
----
curl $REGISURL -o $ELEM/eib_quickstart/elemental/elemental_config.yaml
----

[,yaml]

EOF
----
[NOTE]
====
* The unencoded password is `eib`
* The `cat` command has `\` before each `$` so that bash doesn't template them. If you want to copy the encoded password separately it is `$6$jHugJNNd3HElGsUZ$eodjVe4te5ps44SVcWshdfWizrP.xAyd71CVEXazBJ/.v799/WRCBXxfYmunlBO2yp1hm/zb4r8EmnrrNCF.P/`.

 build --definition-file eib-config.yaml
----

TODO: update image to released image on release


If you are booting a physical device, we need to burn the image to a USB flash drive. This can be done with:

----
sudo dd if=/eib_quickstart/elemental-image.iso of=/dev/<PATH_TO_DISK_DEVICE>
----


=== Boot downstream nodes

Now that we have the installation media created, we can boot our downstream nodes with it.

For each of the systems that you want to control with Elemental, add the installation media and boot the device. After installation, it will reboot and register itself.

If you are using the UI Extension, you should see your node appear in the "Inventory of Machines".

=== Create downstream clusters

There are two objects that we need to create when provisioning a new cluster using Elemental.

[.tabs]
Linux::
The first is the MachineInventorySelectorTemplate. This object allows us to specify a mapping between Clusters and the machines in inventory.
+
. Create a file called `selector.yaml` with the contents:
+
[,yaml]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/selector.yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
metadata:
  name: location-123-selector
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          locationID: '123'
EOF
----
+
. Then we can create it with
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f $ELEM/selector.yaml
----
+
. This will match any machine in the inventory with the label `locationID: 123` so we need to add this label to the machines that should be matched. We can do this by first getting the name of the machine with:
+
[,bash]
----
MACHINENAME=$(kubectl get MachineInventory -n fleet-default | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}')
----
+
Then we can:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl label MachineInventory -n fleet-default \
 $MACHINENAME locationID=123
----
+
. Next, we create the cluster itself. There are a lot of options here but a simple single-node K3s Cluster that we will name `cluster.yaml` looks like:
+
[,yaml]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/cluster.yaml
apiVersion: provisioning.cattle.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: location-123
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  kubernetesVersion: v1.26.11+k3s2
  rkeConfig:
    machinePools:
      - name: pool1
        quantity: 1
        etcdRole: true
        controlPlaneRole: true
        workerRole: true
        machineConfigRef:
          kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
          name: location-123-selector
          apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
EOF
----
To apply it:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f $ELEM/cluster.yaml
----
+
UI Extension::
The UI extension allows for a few shortcuts to be taken. (But is likely to much manual work when managing a large number of locations)
+
. As before, open the left "hamburger menu" and select "OS Management". This will bring you back to the main screen for managing you Elemental systems.
. On the left sidebar, click "Inventory of Machines". This, unsurprisingly, opens the inventory of machines that have registered.
. To create a cluster from these machines, select the system(s) you want, click the "Actions" dropdown, then "Create Elemental Cluster". This will open up the Cluster Creation dialog while also creating a MachineSelectorTemplate to use in the background.
. On this screen, you can configure the cluster you want to be built. For this quickstart, I will select K3s v1.26.11+k3s2 and leave the rest of the options alone.
+

[TIP]
====
You may need to scroll down to see more options
====

TODO: Screenshots

After creating these objects, you should see a new kubernetes cluster spin up using the new node you just installed with.

[TIP]
====
To allow for easier grouping of systems, you could add a startup script that finds something in the environment that is known to be unique to that location.

For example, if you know that each location will have a unique subnet, you would write a script that finds the network prefix and adds a label to the corresponding MachineInventory.

This would typically be custom to your system's design but could look like:

[,bash]
----
INET=`ip addr show dev eth0 | grep "inet\ "`
elemental-register --label "network=$INET" \
 --label "network=$INET" /oem/registration
----

== Next steps

Some recommended next places to research after using this guide are:

* End to end automation with <<components-fleet>>
* Additional network configuration options with the <<components-eib>>

== Planned changes

There are a few changes to this that are currently planned (at time of writing):

=== Improved support for and integration with SLE Micro 6.x

* Image building done in the Elemental Operator
* Both A/B and RPM based transactional updates
* UI improvements for non-teal images

These improvements are expected to be included in an upcoming release.
