Elemental is a software stack that provides for remote control over the lifecycle of the Operating System, Kubernetes and workload in a secure and declarative way.

== Why use this method

Elemental can be useful for scenarios where the devices that you want to control are not on the same network as the upstream cluster or do not have a BMC onboard to allow more direct control.

This is a common scenario for use cases in Retail, IIoT or other spaces where you have little control over the network your devices are being installed in.

== High-level architecture

image::quickstart-elemental-architecture.png[]

== Resources needed

At the very least, you need:

* A host for the management cluster (the one hosting Rancher and Elemental):
 ** Minimum 8 GB RAM and 20 GB disk space for development or testing (see https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements#hardware-requirements[here] for production use)
* A host to be controlled (a virtual machine can be used for demoing or testing purposes)
 ** Minimum 25 GB disk
* A resolvable host name for the management cluster or a static IP address to use with a service like sslip.io
* A host to build the installation media
 ** Running SLES 15 SP5 or openSUSE Leap 15.5
 ** With https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/[Kubectl], https://podman.io[Podman], and https://helm.sh[Helm] installed
 ** For most people, this is their local desktop
* A USB flash drive to boot from (if using physical hardware)
 ** Existing data is overwritten as part of the process

This guide is created using a Digital Ocean droplet to host the upstream cluster and an Intel NUC as the downstream device. For building the installation media, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is used.

== How to use Elemental

The basic steps to install and use Elemental are:

* <<build-bootstrap-cluster>>
* <<install-rancher>>
* <<install-elemental, Install Elemental Operator and Rancher UI extension>>
* <<build-installation-media, Build installer disk>>
* <<boot-downstream-nodes, Boot device with installer>>
* <<create-downstream-clusters>>

=== Build bootstrap cluster [[build-bootstrap-cluster]]

Start by creating a cluster capable of hosting Rancher and Elemental. This cluster needs to be routable from the network that the downstream nodes are connected to.

==== Create Kubernetes cluster

If you are using a hyperscaler (such as Azure, AWS or Google Cloud), the easiest way to set up a cluster is using their built-in tools. For the sake of conciseness in this guide, we do not detail the process of each of these options.

If you are installing onto bare metal or another hosting service where you need to also provide the Kubernetes distribution itself, we recommend using https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart[RKE2].

==== Set up DNS

Before continuing, you need to set up access to your cluster. As with the setup of the cluster itself, how you configure DNS is be different depending on where it is being hosted.

[TIP]
====
If you do not want to handle setting up DNS records (for example, this is just an ephemeral test server), you can use a service like https://sslip.io[sslip.io] instead. With this service, you can resolve any IP address with `<address>.sslip.io`.
====

=== Install Rancher [[install-rancher]]

To install Rancher, you need to get access to the Kubernetes API of the cluster you just created. This looks differently depending on what distribution of Kubernetes is being used.

[NOTE]
====
For Rancher Prime customers, please use the Rancher Prime installation instructions provided to you. 
====

For RKE2, the kubeconfig file will have been written to `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`.
Save this file as `~/.kube/config` on your local system.
You may need to edit the file to include the correct externally routable IP address or host name.

Install Rancher easily with the commands from the https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster[Rancher Documentation]:

. Install https://cert-manager.io[cert-manager]:
+
[.tabs]
Linux::
+
[,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest

kubectl create namespace cattle-system

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update

helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
 --namespace cert-manager \
 --create-namespace
----
+
Windows::
+
[,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest

kubectl create namespace cattle-system

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml

helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager `
  --namespace cert-manager `
  --create-namespace
----
+
. Then install Rancher itself:
+
[.tabs]
Linux::
+
[,bash]
----
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=<DNS or sslip from above> \
  --set replicas=1 \
  --set bootstrapPassword=<PASSWORD_FOR_RANCHER_ADMIN>
----
+
Windows::
+
[,bash]
----
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher `
  --namespace cattle-system `
  --set hostname=<DNS or sslip from above> `
  --set replicas=1 `
  --set bootstrapPassword=<PASSWORD_FOR_RANCHER_ADMIN>
----

[NOTE]
====
If this is intended to be a production system, please use cert-manager to configure a real certificate (such as one from Let's Encrypt).
====

Browse to the host name you set up and log in to Rancher with the `bootstrapPassword` you used. You will be guided through a short setup process.

=== Install Elemental [[install-elemental]]

With Rancher installed, you can now install Elemental itself.

The Helm chart for Elemental is published as an OCI artifact so the installation is a little simpler than other charts.
It can be installed from either the same shell you used to install Rancher or in the browser from within Rancher's shell.

[,bash]
----
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \
 elemental-operator-crds \
 oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-crds-chart
 
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \
 elemental-operator \
 oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-chart
----

==== (Optionally) Install the Elemental UI extension

. To use the Elemental UI, log in to your Rancher instance, click the three-dot menu in the upper left:
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-1.png[Installing Elemental extension1]
+
. From the "Available" tab on this page, click "Install" on the Elemental card:
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-2.png[Installing Elemental extension 2]
+
. Confirm that you want to install the extension:
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-3.png[Installing Elemental extension 3]
+
. After it installs, you will be prompted to reload the page.
+
image::installing-elemental-extension-4.png[Installing Elemental extension 4]
+
. Once you reload, you can access the Elemental extension through the "OS Management" global app.
+
image::accessing-elemental-extension.png[Accessing Elemental extension]

==== Configure Elemental

For simplicity, we recommend setting the variable `$ELEM` to the full path of where you want the configuration directory:

[,shell]
----
export ELEM=$HOME/elemental
mkdir -p $ELEM
----

To allow machines to register to Elemental, we need to create a `MachineRegistration` object in the `fleet-default` namespace.

Let us create a basic version of this object:

[,shell]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/registration.yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineRegistration
metadata:
  name: ele-quickstart-nodes
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  machineName: "\${System Information/Manufacturer}-\${System Information/UUID}"
  machineInventoryLabels:
    manufacturer: "\${System Information/Manufacturer}"
    productName: "\${System Information/Product Name}"
EOF

kubectl apply -f $ELEM/registration.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
The `cat` command escapes each `$` with a backslash (`\`) so that Bash does not template them. Remove the backslashes if copying manually.
====

Once the object is created, find and note the endpoint that gets assigned:

[,bash]
----
REGISURL=$(kubectl get machineregistration ele-quickstart-nodes -n fleet-default -o jsonpath='{.status.registrationURL}')
----

Alternatively, this can also be done from the UI.

UI Extension::
+
. From the OS Management extension, click "Create Registration Endpoint":
+
image::click-create-registration.png[Click Create Registration]
+
. Give this configuration a name.
+
image::create-registration-name.png[Add Name]
+
[NOTE]
====
You can ignore the Cloud Configuration field as the data here is overridden by the following steps with Edge Image Builder.
====
. Next, scroll down and click "Add Label" for each label you want to be on the resource that gets created when a machine registers. This is useful for distinguishing machines.
+
image::create-registration-labels.png[Add Labels]
+
. Lastly, click "Create" to save the configuration.
+
image::create-registration-create.png[Click Create]

UI Extension::
If you just created the configuration, you should see the Registration URL listed and can click "Copy" to copy the address:
+
image::get-registration-url.png[Copy URL]
+
[TIP]
====
If you clicked away from that screen, you can click "Registration Endpoints" in the left menu, then click the name of the endpoint you just created.
====

This URL is used in the next step.

=== Build the installation media [[build-installation-media]]

While the current version of Elemental (at the time of writing) has a way to build its own installation media, we need to do this with the Edge Image Builder instead, so the resulting system is built with https://www.suse.com/products/micro/[SLE Micro] as the base Operating System.

[TIP]
====
For more details on the Edge Image Builder, check out the <<quickstart-eib,Getting Started Guide for it>> and also the <<components-eib,Component Documentation>>.
====

From a Linux system with Podman installed, run:

[,bash]
----
mkdir -p $ELEM/eib_quickstart/base-images
mkdir -p $ELEM/eib_quickstart/elemental
----

[,bash]
----
curl $REGISURL -o $ELEM/eib_quickstart/elemental/elemental_config.yaml
----

[,bash]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/eib_quickstart/eib-config.yaml
apiVersion: 1.0
image:
    imageType: iso
    arch: x86_64
    baseImage: SLE-Micro.x86_64-5.5.0-Default-SelfInstall-GM.install.iso
    outputImageName: elemental-image.iso
operatingSystem:
  users:
    - username: root
      encryptedPassword: \$6\$jHugJNNd3HElGsUZ\$eodjVe4te5ps44SVcWshdfWizrP.xAyd71CVEXazBJ/.v799/WRCBXxfYmunlBO2yp1hm/zb4r8EmnrrNCF.P/
EOF
----

[NOTE]
====
* The unencoded password is `eib`.
* The `cat` command escapes each `$` with a backslash (`\`) so that Bash does not template them. Remove the backslashes if copying manually.
====

[,bash]
----
podman run --privileged --rm -it -v $ELEM/eib_quickstart/:/eib \
 registry.suse.com/edge/edge-image-builder:1.0.1 \
 build --definition-file eib-config.yaml
----

If you are booting a physical device, we need to burn the image to a USB flash drive. This can be done with:

[,bash]
----
sudo dd if=/eib_quickstart/elemental-image.iso of=/dev/<PATH_TO_DISK_DEVICE>
----

=== Boot the downstream nodes [[boot-downstream-nodes]]

Now that we have created the installation media, we can boot our downstream nodes with it.

For each of the systems that you want to control with Elemental, add the installation media and boot the device. After installation, it will reboot and register itself.

If you are using the UI extension, you should see your node appear in the "Inventory of Machines."

=== Create downstream clusters [[create-downstream-clusters]]

There are two objects we need to create when provisioning a new cluster using Elemental.

[.tabs]
Linux::
The first is the `MachineInventorySelectorTemplate`. This object allows us to specify a mapping between clusters and the machines in the inventory.
+
. Create a selector which will match any machine in the inventory with a label:
+
[,yaml]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/selector.yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
metadata:
  name: location-123-selector
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          locationID: '123'
EOF
----
+
. Apply the resource to the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f $ELEM/selector.yaml
----
+
. Obtain the name of the machine and add the matching label:
+
[,bash]
----
MACHINENAME=$(kubectl get MachineInventory -n fleet-default | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}')

kubectl label MachineInventory -n fleet-default \
 $MACHINENAME locationID=123
----
+
. Create a simple single-node K3s cluster resource and apply it to the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
cat << EOF > $ELEM/cluster.yaml
apiVersion: provisioning.cattle.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: location-123
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  kubernetesVersion: v1.28.8+k3s1
  rkeConfig:
    machinePools:
      - name: pool1
        quantity: 1
        etcdRole: true
        controlPlaneRole: true
        workerRole: true
        machineConfigRef:
          kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
          name: location-123-selector
          apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
EOF

kubectl apply -f $ELEM/cluster.yaml
----
+
UI Extension::
The UI extension allows for a few shortcuts to be taken. (Managing multiple locations may involve too much manual workl work.)
+
. As before, open the left three-dot menu and select "OS Management." This brings you back to the main screen for managing your Elemental systems.
. On the left sidebar, click "Inventory of Machines." This opens the inventory of machines that have registered.
. To create a cluster from these machines, select the systems you want, click the "Actions" drop-down list, then "Create Elemental Cluster." This opens the Cluster Creation dialog while also creating a MachineSelectorTemplate to use in the background.
. On this screen, configure the cluster you want to be built. For this quick start, K3s v1.28.8+k3s1 is selected and the rest of the options are left as is.
+
[TIP]
====
You may need to scroll down to see more options.
====

After creating these objects, you should see a new Kubernetes cluster spin up using the new node you just installed with.

[TIP]
====
To allow for easier grouping of systems, you could add a startup script that finds something in the environment that is known to be unique to that location.

For example, if you know that each location will have a unique subnet, you can write a script that finds the network prefix and adds a label to the corresponding MachineInventory.

This would typically be custom to your system's design but could look like:

[,bash]
----
INET=`ip addr show dev eth0 | grep "inet\ "`
elemental-register --label "network=$INET" \
 --label "network=$INET" /oem/registration
----
====

== Next steps

Here are some recommended resources to research after using this guide:

* End-to-end automation in <<components-fleet>>
* Additional network configuration options in <<components-nmc>>

== Planned changes

There are a few changes to this guide that are currently planned (at the time of writing):

=== Improved support for and integration with SLE Micro 6.x

* Image building done in the Elemental Operator
* Both A/B and RPM-based transactional updates
* UI improvements for non-teal images

These improvements are expected to be included in an upcoming release.
