.Common and expected behavior
* Expose rancher service:

In case it is not clear, when using RKE2/K3S you need to expose services (rancher in this context) from the management cluster as it is not exposed by default. 
In RKE2 there is an nginx ingress controller, in k3s there is traefik.
The current workflow suggests using metallb for L2advertising and the relevant ingress controller to create an ingress via HelmChartConfig (as if doing a new ingress object would override existing setup).

_Example:_

-> Install Rancher Prime (via helm) and set some values to it:
```
---
hostname: rancher-192.168.64.101.sslip.io
replicas: 1
bootstrapPassword: Admin
global.cattle.psp.enabled: "false"
```

-> Create a LoadBalancer service to expose rancher:
```
---
apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
kind: HelmChartConfig
metadata:
  name: rke2-ingress-nginx
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  valuesContent: |-
    controller:
      config:
        use-forwarded-headers: "true"
        enable-real-ip: "true"
      publishService:
        enabled: true
      service:
        enabled: true
        type: LoadBalancer
        externalTrafficPolicy: Local
```

-> Create an IP Address Pool for the service (remember to assign the IP you set up in the Rancher chart values):
```
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: ingress-ippool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.64.101/32
  serviceAllocation:
    priority: 100
    serviceSelectors:
    - matchExpressions:
      - {key: app.kubernetes.io/name, operator: In, values: [rke2-ingress-nginx]}
```

-> Create an L2 Advertisement for the IP Pool:
```
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: ingress-l2-adv
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - ingress-ippool
```

* Make sure to install all elemental bits:

you need to install elemental operator, elemental crds, elemental ui on the management nodes and add the elemental configuration on the downstream node together with a registration code, as that will prompt Edge Image Builder to download the proper elemental client packages for registering the machine.

.Hardware Specific

* TPM: 

you might see some error that looks like this:

```
Nov 25 18:17:06 eled elemental-register[4038]: Error: registering machine: cannot generate authentication token: opening tpm for getting attestation data: TPM device not available
```

In this case you will need to do one of the following:
- enable TPM on your VM, for example: https://elemental.docs.rancher.com/tpm/ ( for UTM on Mac see the image below) 

image::tpm.png[TPM]

- disable TPM altogether, by setting in the MachineRegistration file:
```
      registration:
        emulate-tpm: false
```
- leave TPM enabled, but use a negative value for emulating the TPM seed, so the seed used for the TPM emulation is randomized per machine.
```
      registration:
        emulate-tpm: true
        emulated-tpm-seed: -1
```
