The link:https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller[system-upgrade-controller] (*SUC*) is the cornerstone application for supporting both *OS* and *Kubernetes* updates/upgrades. As such, it must be deployed on all downstream clusters before any update/upgrade operation is performed.

=== Deployment

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you will be using <<components-fleet,Fleet>> to orchestrate the *SUC* deployment. Users using a third-party GitOps workflow, should see <<third_party_git_ops>> for information on what resources they need to setup in their workflow.
====

The link:https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller[system-upgrade-controller] (*SUC*) application can be deployed using Fleet's *GitRepo* or *Bundle* resources.

*GitRepos* are resources that represent Git repositories from which *Fleet* will create *Bundles*. Each *Bundle* is created from paths in the *GitRepo*. For more information, see the https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-add[GitRepo] documentation.

*Bundles* are resources that are created either by *Fleet* from *GitRepos* or by manually deploying them to the correct *Fleet* namespace. They hold the *raw* Kubernetes resources that will be deployed on the target clusters. For more information, see the https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add[Bundle] documentation.

From a *SUC* deployment point of view the *GitRepo* and *Bundle* resources can be used on the following environment use-cases:

. `GitRepo` - normally used for *non air-gapped* deployments of *SUC* on environments that utilise a <<components-fleet,Fleet>> GitOps approach. Alternatively, if you mirror your repository setup through a *local git server*, it can also be used for an *air-gapped* deployments.

. `Bundle` - normally used for *air-gapped* deployments of *SUC* on environments that do not have a *local git server* setup, or do not adopt a GitOps workflow approach. Depending on your use-case, it can also be used for *non air-gapped* deployments.

The Edge team maintains a ready to use `GitRepo` and `Bundle` resources for *SUC* in each of our `suse-edge/fleet-examples` link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[releases]. Users can choose to use the files directly from the desired release, or copy them to their own repository. 

==== SUC deployment using a GitRepo resource

This section covers how to create a `GitRepo` resource that will ship the needed resources for a successful *SUC* deployment to your *target* downstream clusters.

`GitRepo` creation can be done either though the `Rancher` UI (when `Rancher` is available) or by manually deploying it in the correct `Fleet` namespace. For additional `GitRepo` information, see the link:https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-gitrepo[GitRepo Resource] documentation.

Once created, `Fleet` will be responsible for pickuping the resource and deploying the *SUC* resources to all your *target* clusters. For information on how to track the deployment process, see <<monitor_suc_deployment>>.

===== GitRepo deployment - Rancher UI

. In the upper left corner, *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Git Repos -> Add Repository*

If you use the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository:

. *Repository URL* - `https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples.git`

. *Watch -> Revision* - choose a link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag for the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository that you wish to use, e.g. `edge-3.0.0`.

. Under *Paths* add the path to the *system-upgrade-controller* as seen in the release tag - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller`

. Select *Next* to move to the *target* configuration section

. *Only select clusters for which you wish to deploy the `system-upgrade-controller`.* When you are satisfied with your configurations, click *Create*

Alternatively, if you decide to use your own repository to host these files, you would need to provide your repo data above.

===== GitRepo creation - manual

. Choose the desired Edge link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag that you wish to deploy the *SUC* `GitRepo` from (referenced below as `$\{REVISION\}`).

. Pull the *GitRepo* resource:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -o system-upgrade-controller-gitrepo.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/{REVISION}/gitrepos/day2/system-upgrade-controller-gitrepo.yaml
----

. Edit the *GitRepo* configurations, under `spec.targets` specify your desired target list. By default the `GitRepo` resources from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` are *NOT* mapped to any down stream clusters.

** To match all clusters change the default `GitRepo` *target* to:
+
[, bash]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** Alternatively, if you want a more granular cluster selection see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]

. Apply the *GitRepo* resource to your *Rancher Management Cluster*:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f system-upgrade-controller-gitrepo.yaml
----

. View the created *GitRepo* resource under the `fleet-default` namespace:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get gitrepo system-upgrade-controller -n fleet-default

# Example output
NAME                        REPO                                               COMMIT       BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY   STATUS
system-upgrade-controller   https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples.git   edge-3.0.0   0/0

==== SUC deployment using a Bundle resource

This section covers how to create a `Bundle` resource that will ship the needed resources for a successful *SUC* deployment to your *target* downstream clusters.

`Bundle` creation can be done either through the `Rancher` UI (when `Rancher` is available) or by manually deploying it in the correct `Fleet` namespace. For additional `Bundle` information, see the link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add[Create a Bundle Resource]documentation.

Once created, `Fleet` will process the `Bundle` data and deploy the needed *SUC* deployment resources to the *target* downstream clusters. For information on how to track the deployment process, see <<monitor_suc_deployment>>.

===== Bundle creation - Rancher UI

. In the upper left corner, *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Advanced* > *Bundles*

. Select *Create from YAML*

. From here you can create the Bundle in one of the following ways:

** By manually copying the file content to the *Create from YAML* page. File content can be retrieved from this url - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/$\{REVISION\}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller/controller-bundle.yaml. Where `$\{REVISION\}` is the Edge link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag that you desire (e.g. `edge-3.0.0`).

** By cloning the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository to the desired link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag and selecting the *Read from File* option in the *Create from YAML* page. From there, navigate to `bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller` directory and select `controller-bundle.yaml`. This will auto-populate the *Create from YAML* page with the Bundle content.

. Change the *target* clusters for the `Bundle`:

** To match all downstream clusters change the default Bundle `.spec.targets` to:
+
[, bash]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** For a more granular downstream cluster mappings, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters].

. *Create*

===== Bundle creation - manual

. Choose the desired Edge link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag that you wish to deploy the *SUC* `Bundle` from (referenced below as `$\{REVISION\}`).

. Pull the *Bundle* resource:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -o controller-bundle.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/${REVISION}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller/controller-bundle.yaml
----

. Edit the `Bundle` *target* configurations, under `spec.targets` provide your desired target list. By default the `Bundle` resources from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` are *NOT* mapped to any down stream clusters.

** To match all clusters change the default `Bundle` *target* to:
+
[, bash]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** Alternatively, if you want a more granular cluster selection see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]

. Apply the *Bundle* resource to your *Rancher Management Cluster*:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f controller-bundle.yaml 
----

. View the created *Bundle* resource under the `fleet-default` namespace:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get bundles system-upgrade-controller -n fleet-default

# Example output
NAME                        BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY   STATUS
system-upgrade-controller   0/0

[#third_party_git_ops]
==== Deploying system-upgrade-controller when using a third-party GitOps workflow

To deploy the `system-upgrade-controller` using a third-party GitOps tool, depending on the tool, you might need information for the `system-upgrade-controller` Helm chart or Kubernetes resoruces, or both.

Choose a specific Edge link:https://github.com/ipetrov117/fleet-examples/releases[release] from which you wish to use the *SUC* from.

From there, the *SUC* Helm chart data can be found under the `helm` configuration section of the `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller/fleet.ymal` file.

The *SUC* Kubernetes resources can be found under the *SUC* `Bundle` configuration under `.spec.resources.content`. The location for the bundle is `bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller/controller-bundle.yaml`.

Use the above mentioned resoruces to populate the data that your third-party GitOps workflow needs in order to deploy *SUC*.

=== Monitor SUC resources using Rancher

This section covers how to monitor the lifecycle of the *SUC* deployment and any deployed *SUC* Plans using the Rancher UI.

[#monitor_suc_deployment]
==== Monitor SUC deployment

To check the *SUC* pod logs for a specific cluster:

. In the upper left corner, *☰ -> <your-cluster-name>*

. Select *Workloads -> Pods*

. Under the namespace drop down menu select the `cattle-system` namespace

+
image::day2-monitor-suc-deployment-1.png[]

. In the Pod filter bar, write the *SUC* name - `system-upgrade-controller`

. On the right of the pod select *⋮ -> View Logs*
+
image::day2-monitor-suc-deployment-2.png[]

. The *SUC* logs should looks something similar to:
+
image::day2-monitor-suc-deployment-3.png[]

[#monitor_suc_plans]
==== Monitor SUC Plans

[IMPORTANT]
====
The *SUC Plan* Pods are kept alive for *15* minutes. After that they are removed by the corresponding Job that created them. To have access to the *SUC Plan* Pod logs, you should enable logging for your cluster. For information on how to do this in Rancher, see link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/integrations-in-rancher/logging[Rancher Integration with Logging Services].
====

To check *Pod* logs for the specific *SUC* plan:

. In the upper left corner, *☰ -> <your-cluster-name>*

. Select *Workloads -> Pods*

. Under the namespace drop down menu select the `cattle-system` namespace
+
image::day2-monitor-suc-deployment-1.png[]

. In the Pod filter bar, write the name for your *SUC Plan* Pod. The name will be in the following template format: `apply-<plan_name>-on-<node_name>`
+
.Example Kubernetes upgrade plan pods
image::day2-k8s-plan-monitor.png[]
+
Note how in _Figure 1_, we have one Pod in *Completed* and one in *Unknown* state. This is expected and has happened due to the Kubernetes version upgrade on the node.
+
.Example OS pacakge update plan pods
image::day2-os-pkg-plan-monitor.png[]

. Select the pod that you want to review the logs of and navigate to *⋮ -> View Logs*
