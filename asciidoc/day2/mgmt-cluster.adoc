This section covers how to perform the various `Day 2` operations related to upgrading your `management` cluster from one Edge platform version to another.

The `Day 2` operations are automated by the <<components-upgrade-controller, Upgrade Controller>> and include:

* <<components-slmicro, SUSE Linux Micro>> OS upgrade

* <<components-rke2, RKE2>>/<<components-k3s, K3s>> upgrade

* SUSE additional components (Rancher, SUSE Security, etc.) upgrade

== Prerequisites

Before upgrading your `management` cluster, the following prerequisites must be met:

. `SCC registered nodes` - ensure your cluster nodes' OS are registered with a subscription key that supports the OS version specified in the Edge <<release-notes,release>> you intend to upgrade to.

. `Upgrade Controller` - make sure that the `Upgrade Controller` has been deployed on your `management` cluster. For installation steps, refer to <<components-upgrade-controller-installation, Installing the Upgrade Controller>>.

== Upgrade

. Determine the Edge <<release-notes,release>> version that you wish to upgrade your `management` cluster to.

. In the `management` cluster, deploy an `UpgradePlan` that specifies the desired `release version`. The `UpgradePlan` must be deployed in the namespace of the `Upgrade Controller`.

[NOTE]
====
There may be use-cases where you would want to make additional configurations over the `UpgradePlan`. For all possible configurations, refer to the <<components-upgrade-controller-extensions-upgrade-plan, UpgradePlan>> section.
====

. Deploying the `UpgradePlan` to the `Upgrade Controller's` namespace will begin the `upgrade process`.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on the actual `upgrade process`, refer to <<components-upgrade-controller-how, How does the Upgrade Controller work?>>.

For information on how to track the `upgrade process`, refer to <<components-upgrade-controller-how-track, Tracking the upgrade process>>.
