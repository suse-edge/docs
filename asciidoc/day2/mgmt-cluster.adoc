This section covers how to do various `Day 2` operations on a `management cluster`.

== RKE2 upgrade

[NOTE]
====
To ensure *disaster recovery*, we advise to do a backup of the RKE2 cluster data. For information on how to do this, check link:https://docs.rke2.io/backup_restore[here]. The default location for the `rke2` binary is `/opt/rke2/bin`.
====

You can upgrade the RKE2 version using the RKE2 installation script as follows:

[source,bash]
----
curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=vX.Y.Z+rke2rN sh -
----

Remember to restart the `rke2` process after installing:

[source,bash]
----
# For server nodes:
systemctl restart rke2-server

# For agent nodes:
systemctl restart rke2-agent
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
To avoid any unforseen upgrade problems, use the following node upgrade order:

. _Server nodes_ - should be upgraded *one* node at a time.
. _Agent nodes_  - should be upgraded after *all* server node upgrades have finished. Can be upgraded in parallel.
====

_For further information, see the link:https://docs.rke2.io/upgrade/manual_upgrade#upgrade-rke2-using-the-installation-script[RKE2 upgrade documentation]._

== OS upgrade

NOTE: This section assumes that you have registered your system to https://scc.suse.com.

SUSE regularly releases new `SLE Micro` package updates. To retrieve the updated package versions SLE Micro uses `transactional-upgrade`.

`transactional-upgrade` provides an application and library to update a Linux operating system in a transactional way, i.e. the update will be performed in the background while the system continues running as it is. Only after you *reboot* the system will the update take effect. For further information, see the `transactional-update` https://github.com/openSUSE/transactional-update[GitHub] GitHub page.

.To update all packages in the system, execute:
[source,bash]
----
transactional-update
----

Since *rebooting* the node will result in it being unavailable for some time, if you are running a multi-node cluster, you can https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_cordon/[cordon] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_drain/[drain] the node before the *reboot*.

.To cordon a node, execute:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl cordon <node>
----

This will result in the node being taken out of the default scheduling mechanism, ensuring that no pods will be assinged to it by mistake.

.To drain a node, execute:
[source, bash]
----
kubectl drain <node>
----

This will ensure that all workloads on the node will be transferred to other available nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on what workloads you are running on the node, you might also need to provide additional flags (e.g. `--delete-emptydir-data`, `--ignore-daemonsets`) to the command.
====

.Reboot node:
[source,bash]
----
sudo reboot
----

After a successful reboot, the packages on your node will be updated. The only thing left is to bring the node back to the default scheduling mechanism with the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_uncordon/[uncordon] command.

.Uncordon node:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl uncordon <node>
----

[NOTE]
====
In case you want to revert the update, use the above steps with the following `transactional-update` command:

[source,bash]
----
transactional-update rollback last
----
====

== Rancher upgrade

[NOTE]
====
To ensure disaster recovery, we advise to do a Rancher backup. For information on how to do this, check link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher[here].
====

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you have installed `helm` on your system. For `helm` installation instructions, check link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[here].
====

=== EIB created Rancher instance

If you have chosen to deploy `Rancher` as part of EIB's <<quickstart-eib-definition-file, image definition file>>, you need to upgrade the `rancher.yaml` file that EIB creates under `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests` on your `initializer` node. To deploy helm charts in its `image definition` file, EIB takes advantage of RKE2's manifest https://docs.rke2.io/advanced#auto-deploying-manifests[auto-deploy] functionality.

. Locate the `initializer` node

** For multi-node clusters - in your EIB image definition file, you should have specified the `initializer: true` property for one of your nodes. If you have not specified this property, the initializer node will be the first *server* node in your node list.

** For single-node clusters - the initializer is the currently running node

. SSH to the `initializer` node:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh root@<node_ip>
----

. Add the `Rancher Prime` Helm repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-prime https://charts.rancher.com/server-charts/prime
----

. Fetch the latest `Rancher Prime` helm chart version:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher

# Alternatively if you want to fetch a specific verison
helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher --version=X.Y.Z
----

. Encode `.tgz` archive so that it can be passed to a `HelmChart` CR config:
+
[source,bash]
----
base64 -w 0 rancher-X.Y.Z.tgz  > rancher-X.Y.Z-encoded.txt

# Example for Rancher 2.8.3
base64 -w 0 rancher-2.8.3.tgz  > rancher-2.8.3-encoded.txt
----

. Make a copy of the `rancher.yaml` file that we will edit:
+
[source, bash]
----
cp /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rancher.yaml ./rancher.yaml
----

. Change the `chartContent` and `version` configurations of the `rancher.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
sed -i -e "s|chartContent:.*|chartContent: $(<rancher-X.Y.Z-encoded.txt)|" -e "s|version:.*|version: X.Y.Z|" rancher.yaml

# Example for Rancher 2.8.3
sed -i -e "s|chartContent:.*|chartContent: $(<rancher-2.8.3-encoded.txt)|" -e "s|version:.*|version: 2.8.3|" rancher.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you need to do any additional upgrade changes to the chart (e.g. adding *new* custom chart values), you need to manually edit the `rancher.yaml` file.
====

. Replace the original `rancher.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp rancher.yaml /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/
----


The above commands will trigger an upgrade of the `Rancher` instance. The upgrade will be handled by the https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller#helm-controller[helm-controller].

To verify the update:

. List pods in `default` namespace: 
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n default

# Example output
NAME                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
helm-install-cert-manager-7v7nm   0/1     Completed   0          88m
helm-install-rancher-p99k5        0/1     Completed   0          3m21s
----

. Look at the logs of the `helm-install-rancher-*` pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl logs <helm_install_rancher_pod> -n default

# Example
kubectl logs helm-install-rancher-p99k5 -n default
----

. Verify `Rancher` pods are running:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n cattle-system

# Example output
NAME                               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
helm-operation-mccvd               0/2     Completed   0          3m52s
helm-operation-np8kn               0/2     Completed   0          106s
helm-operation-q8lf7               0/2     Completed   0          2m53s
rancher-648d4fbc6c-qxfpj           1/1     Running     0          5m27s
rancher-648d4fbc6c-trdnf           1/1     Running     0          9m57s
rancher-648d4fbc6c-wvhbf           1/1     Running     0          9m57s
rancher-webhook-649dcc48b4-zqjs7   1/1     Running     0          100s
----

. Verify `Rancher` version upgrade:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get settings.management.cattle.io server-version

# Example output for Rancher 2.8.3 upgrade
NAME             VALUE
server-version   v2.8.3
----

=== Non-EIB created Rancher instance

. Update your local helm cache:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo update
----

. Get `Rancher Prime` helm repo:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-prime https://charts.rancher.com/server-charts/prime
----

. Fetch the latest `Rancher Prime` helm chart version:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher

# Alternatively if you want to fetch a specific verison
helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher --version=X.Y.Z
----
+
This should produce a `rancher-<version>.tgz` file in your current working directory.

. Get the values for the current Rancher release and print them to a `rancher-values.yaml` file
+
[source,bash]
----
helm get values rancher -n cattle-system -o yaml > rancher-values.yaml
----

. Update the helm chart
+
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade rancher rancher-prime/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  -f rancher-values.yaml \
  --version=2.X.Y
----

. Verify `Rancher` version upgrade:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get settings.management.cattle.io server-version

# Example output for Rancher 2.8.3 upgrade
NAME             VALUE
server-version   v2.8.3
----
