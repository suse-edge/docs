This section explains how to setup and do *Day 2* operations on a `Rancher Management Cluster`.

A `Rancher Management Cluster` is made out of the following components:

* `SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro` - the operating system on which the Kubernetes distribution will operate. For more information, see <<components-slmicro>>

* `RKE2` - the Kubernetes distribution on which the management cluster will operate. For more information, see <<components-rke2>>

* `Rancher` - the management platform that will manage the lifecycle of the downstream clusters. For more information, <<components-rancher>>

Working in cohesion these components enable administrators to easily manage the lifecycle of their downstream clusters from a single location.
